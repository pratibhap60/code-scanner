**Application Flow
	- Upload code / connect to repo
	- Run parsing & static analysis
	- Identify smells via rules + AST analysis
	- Generate report
	- Provide refactoring suggestions
	- Store results for history
	- Optionally auto-create PR with fixes (advanced)


**Define Purpose & Scope
 - The application should be able to:
	- Detect code smells in source files or repositories
	- Suggest fixes or refactoring actions
	- Produce a report or dashboard
	- Integrate with CI/CD to prevent regression

**Core Features
	- Code Smell Detection Engine with the Feature:
		- Include Long Method
		- Include Large Class
		- Include Long Parameter List
		- Include Magic Numbers/Strings
		- Include God Object
		- Include Duplicated Code
		- Include Primitive Obsession
		- Include Feature Envy
		- Include Comment Smell (excessive or outdated comments)
		- Include Shotgun Surgery
		- Include Dead Code
		- Include Cyclic Complexity
		- Include Inconsistent Naming
		- Include Poor Error Handling
		- Include Excessive If/Else / deeply nested structures
		- Include Switch Statements over polymorphism
		- Include Data Clumps

**Suggestions & Refactoring Tips
	- Each smell should map to a set of recommendations:
		- Extract Method / Extract Class
		- Introduce Parameters Object
		- Replace Magic Numbers with Constants
		- Remove Dead Code
		- Inline Temp Variables
		- Use Polymorphism instead of Conditionals
		- Use Dependency Injection
		- Introduce Interface or Abstract Class
		- Split responsibilities (SRP)

**Reporting Dashboard
	- Inlcude Smell summary per file/module
	- Inlcude Severity scoring
	- Inlcude Technical debt estimation
	- Inlcude Trend visualization (smells over time)
	- Inlcude Export as PDF/JSON
